With the polls module you can... create polls. What else would you expect. This module uses the Polls feature that is built-in in Discord.

When a user votes on a poll that counts towards the achievements module. See Achievements for more info.

### Create a poll
The following properties can be added when creating a poll:

* Question
  The question for the poll. Duhh.

* Answers
  You can add up to ten different answers per poll.

* Duration
  The duration is in hours. To a maximum of 32 days (768 hours). This means a poll can not be less than 1 hour.

* Multi select
  A true / false option. Allows the user to select multiple answers if true.

* Channel
  The channel to create the poll in.

A poll can be created with the following command:

* **/poll create** *\<question> \<allow-multiselect> \<channel> \<duration>*

### End an active poll
To end an active poll you need the message ID of the poll and the channel ID the poll was sent in.
You can end a poll with the following command:

* **/poll end** *\<message-id> \<channel-id>*
You can find the message ID by right-clicking on the message and clicking on "Copy Message ID". You can find the channel ID by right-clicking on the channel in the channel list and clicking on "Copy Channel ID".
