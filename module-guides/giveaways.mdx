With the giveaways module you can create giveaways to your liking. Add as many winners as you want, set a duration up to 30 days and only allow people with certain roles to create or join giveaways.

### Module settings & features

* **Admin roles**
  * Users with one of these roles are able to create giveaways. However, they can only end and re-roll their own giveaways. Users with administrator perms can end and re-roll all giveaways.

* **Blacklist roles**
  * Users with a blacklisted role are unable to participate in any giveaways.

* **Channels** *(Default value: enabled in all)*
  * Allow giveaways to only be made in certain channels. You can choose between 2 modes: allow all except & allow only in. With allow all except, giveaways can be created in all channels except the selected channels (Blacklisting channels). With allow only in, giveaways can only be created in the selected channels (Whitelisting channels).

* **Cooldown** *(Default value: 1)*
  * Giveaway winners will be on cooldown. Meaning they are unable to join the next giveaway. Once cooldown has run out they can participate again. Setting this to 0 disables the cooldown.

* **Ping role**
  * This role will be mentioned whenever a new giveaway has been created.

* **5 active giveaways at once**
  * You can have up to 5 active giveaways at once. Giveaways that have ended do not count to this limit.
